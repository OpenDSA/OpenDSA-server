==============

This file is an example (originally created by Philip Guo) of how to visualize the code on a given html page using a div you assign in the ExecutionVisualizer function from the filteredJSON.js file. The filteredJSON.js in this directory was produced from the jsonfilter.py on the backend. The *jsonFilter.py* takes in the raw junit test file and puts everything into a string called printToFile. In this case, I printed it directly to the javaScript file, but it could easily be sent somewhere else before printing.
